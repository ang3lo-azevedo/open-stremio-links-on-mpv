# Open Stremio Web Links on MPV

> This script is intended to be used with the [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com/) website and the [MPV](https://mpv.io/) player.

## How to use:

> 1. **Install the open-in-mpv extension on your browser or run one of their scripts to be able to use the `mpv:///open protocol`**
> 2. **Install the [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) / [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension on your browser, I recommend using Greasemonkey since it is opensource**
> 3. **[Click here to install this script on Greasemonkey / Tampermonkey](https://github.com/ang3lo-azevedo/open-stremio-links-on-mpv/raw/refs/heads/main/open-stremio-links-on-mpv.user.js)**
> 4. **Go to [Stremio Web Settings](https://web.stremio.com/#/settings) and enable in the "Play in external player" option under "Advanced" the "M3U Playlist" option.**
> 5. **Click on a stream link and it will open on MPV!**
