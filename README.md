How to use:

1. Install the [open-in-mpv](https://github.com/Baldomo/open-in-mpv) extension on your browser or run one of their scripts to be able to use the `mpv:///open` protocol
2. Install the [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) / [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension on your browser, I recommend using Greasemonkey since it is opensource
3. Install this script on Greasemonkey / Tampermonkey
4. Go to [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com/) and enable in the "Play in external player" option under "Advanced" the "M3U Playlist" option.
